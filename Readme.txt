This is the code for the paper 'Essential Tensor Learning for Multi-view Spectral Clustering' accepted by IEEE Trans. Image Processing 2019. Please direct run '*.m' file by MATLAB to test the performance. As we fix the random seed in the released code, the parameters might be slightly different. Due to the space limit, We just put three datasets in this folder. If you are interested in other datasets, please feel free to contact me. Our code is based on the RMSC[1] and t-SVD-MSC[2]. If you use our code, please cite our paper as well as these two other papers. Thanks.
